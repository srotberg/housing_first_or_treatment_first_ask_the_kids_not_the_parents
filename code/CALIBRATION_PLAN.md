# Where the calibration is, and what happens next

THIS FILE IS THE CURRENT STATE. The scheduled watch routines used to carry it
in their own prompt text and it went stale within the hour, twice: one of them
was still saying "the sweep is finished, b = 0.1202, do not restart the sweep"
long after 0.12 had been measured at zero participation. A routine's prompt is
written once and fires for days; a file in the repository is updated by the
same commit as the thing it describes. Read this first, and update it when the
state changes rather than editing the routines.

Last updated 24 August 15:40 UTC.

## What is running

A STAGED VECTOR SEARCH, driven by `code/sweep_b.py`, NOT
`supervise_calibration.py`. Do not start the joint calibration loop while it
runs.

A sweep point is a **parameter VECTOR**. `B_SWEEP_FULL.txt` holds the grid, one
point a line:

    0.047 lambda_addiction=4.5 value_of_life=11 size_homelessness=0.304

The first field is b, which the model reads from `B_SWEEP_GRID.txt`. Every other
field goes to `PARAM_HANDOVER.txt`, which the model reads after the state and
deletes as it does, so nothing outlives its point. Any name the Fortran's
handover `select case` knows may be used. A line with only a b runs everything
else at the banked value. `#` starts a comment. `done_points` is keyed on the
whole vector, so two points may share a b and differ elsewhere.

Results bank to `B_SWEEP.tsv` as each point lands, with the vector recorded in
the `set` column, and the driver pushes the branch and merges main.

### Why staged and not a five dimensional grid

Three levels each over h_1, b, lambda, aleph and the employment multiplier is
243 solves at about twenty minutes each: **eighty one hours**. Two levels each is
thirty two points and eleven hours. What the search needs is not every cell but
every parameter measured in a world where the others are not absurd. The author
has agreed to stages.

**Round 1** (running): lambda at 4.5, b swept DOWN over 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03,
with the other nine instruments pinned at their DECLARED values on every point.
b goes down because lambda rising twenty fold from 0.225 moves experimenters
into the disorder and pulls participation down with it.

**Round 2**: aleph and the employment multiplier, at whatever b and lambda round
1 lands on. Both act THROUGH use, so measuring them at a b and lambda that
produce no sensible use measures nothing.

**Then**: h_1 against the homelessness rate, once there is a population to be
homeless.

## The curve measured at the BANKED parameters

These three ran before the staging, at lambda 0.225139 and the banked vector,
and are kept for the shape of the b curve rather than as answers:

    b       participation   users     disorder     income of users
    0.01       0.9051       0.9595    0.0544          0.675
    0.03       0.7456       0.7569    0.0114          0.544
    0.05       0.0690       0.0694    0.000327        0.477

Targets: participation 0.0890, disorder 0.0368.

**b alone cannot land both.** Participation crosses its target near b = 0.047;
the disorder crosses ITS target near b = 0.015. Onset is
`1 - exp(-lambda*quantity)` and b sets the quantity, so the two moments are one
margin and need two instruments. That is why lambda joined the search.

## The order of work the author has set

1. The sweep pins b and lambda. **Report the curve; do not pick the values.**
2. Install `GOOD_START.txt` as `PARAM_HANDOVER.txt` with the chosen b and
   lambda appended. The banked parameters are the record of a chase across a
   world with 75 per cent participation and sit 6x to 106x from their declared
   values.
3. Set `diagnostic_simulation=1` and run ONCE. It freezes the parameters like a
   sweep but without the sweep's early stop, so every moment prints and the
   equilibrium can be READ.
4. Read the moments. Anything still in a corner is adjusted by hand and
   simulated again.
5. Only when nothing is cornered, `diagnostic_simulation=0` and let the slow
   updates run.

## Settled, and not to be re-litigated

- **b = 0.1202 is dead.** 0.12 has been measured at exactly zero participation,
  users and disorder. `B_SWEEP.old_mortality.tsv` and `B_SWEEP.h1_zero.tsv` are
  archives, not current.
- **`size_homelessness` has a floor of 0.01.** Zero prices the street at minus
  infinity: `h_1 = housing_size(0)*size_homelessness` and housing enters utility
  as `h**((1-sigma)*alpha)` with no shifter.
- **J_E = 55 is an age INDEX**, age = index + 25, so onset is possible to 79.
  The author has confirmed it. Do not change it.
- **`theta_hi` is 0.5**, raised because the spending share and the disorder are
  the same margin: theta up for the share, lambda down for the disorder.
- **Steps are state dependent**, through `move_factor`: a moment below a tenth
  of its target or above five times it is a CORNER and its parameter may move by
  `escape_factor` (ten for b, two for the rest); otherwise one per cent a loop.
  The log prints `MOVE MODE <param>=`. Do not hand tune these.

## Reporting

`code/CALIBRATION_TABLE.txt` is written every checkpoint by the supervisor and
`CALIBRATION_TABLE_HISTORY.txt` keeps every round. `/gaps` regenerates it. Show
**every** internally calibrated parameter every time, never a median and never a
selection. The report accounts for all of them, as a row or as a named
exclusion, and closes with `accounted for: N calibrated + M not calibrated`. If
that arithmetic does not add up, say so.

Do not read a rising income of drug users as a fault: Table 7 puts it at 0.74 of
average in the data against 0.41 in the old benchmark. Only a ratio above one is
a problem.

## Operational notes that have cost time

- Check processes with a POSITIONAL `/proc` scan, never `pgrep -f`, which
  matches the shell whose own command line carries the pattern. `argv[0]` ending
  in `hftf` is the model; `argv[0]` a python with `argv[1]` ending in
  `sweep_b.py` is the driver.
- Launch from `code/`, not the repository root.
- After a container rebuild:
  `git fetch origin claude/two-period-addiction-hazard-d7gb61 && git checkout -B claude/two-period-addiction-hazard-d7gb61 FETCH_HEAD`,
  rebuild if `./hftf` is missing or older than the source, then from `code/`:
  `ulimit -s unlimited && setsid nohup python3 sweep_b.py > sweep_b_driver.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &`
- A point is about twenty minutes, a cold solve each.
