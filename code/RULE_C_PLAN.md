# RULE C: THE PLAN TO FINISH THE PAPER (12 October)

The author: "I think we should redo the whole paper with rule C", "all the stuff we are waiting on should be done on rule
C. and all the stuff already in the paper should be redone for rule C including any validation we rely on", "go ahead,
write out the plan, and execute to finish the paper fully finally", "use parallel sessions where you can".

Rule C: a household with the disorder must be in treatment, and no household may use (EO 14321 Sec. 5(b); the
ONDCP/HHS/HUD 2026 toolkit, p. 9). code/treat/patch_treatC.py. Housing First, the no-policy arms and the benchmarks have
no screen and are NOT re-run. The stylized model (Section 3) has no treatment choice and is NOT re-run.

## Workstreams (parallel)

| id | what | where | depends on | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | main Treatment First arm, detection 0.85, $35 test, price and pi_V clearing | cloud session_01RuzfgApLN9fv3B7J6B8kpS, code/treat/remote_treatC.sh -> results/counterfactuals_2c/tf_ruleC | - | building 17:01; INERT CHECK at pass 1 |
| INV | inventory of every Treatment First-dependent number in the paper (validation included) and the run behind it | local agent -> scratchpad ruleC_inventory.md, then into this file | - | running |
| BOTH | both penalties (delta_d 0.24, delta_h 0.31), long run, rule C, single precision + checkpoints; the disk (29 GB) cannot hold the four-class benchmark's text files plus an arm's, so the engineering is part of the job | cloud session_01V66tfNJk92jP5jndoK5C3F (Opus, launched 17:09): engineering, then code/deltah/remote_deltah_both_C.sh -> results/deltah_both_C | - | engineering |
| ARMS | every other rule-C arm the inventory lists (decomposition columns, no-externality columns, detection 0.70 and 0.50, omega_c 0.686, delta_d = 0 with its benchmark re-solved, the Milby split, who-stops and revocation prints), one cloud session each | cloud sessions | C1 passes the inert check; warm start from C1's latest pass | after INV |
| C1-INERT | C1 pass 1: welfare 789.9738 against rule A's 789.9399 at the same start; voucher holders with a SUD 0.0183, of them 0.0137 in treatment (75%) | - | - | PASSED 18:03 |
| S-tf | the main arm re-solved beside Housing First: final, shares, newborn shares (who gains, Table 5's better-off rows) | session_011MbNMbytyRE8eUCaNB6tY3, code/extra_2c/remote_decomp_shares_C.sh tf -> results/decomp_2c_shares_C/arm_tf | C1 warm start | launched 18:21 |
| S-fixboth | Table 5: price and pi_V both held | session_01TNAGv2iochuLa8URX3U78w, remote_decomp_shares_C.sh fixboth -> results/decomp_2c_shares_C/arm_fixboth | - | launched 18:21 |
| S-fixpv | Table 5: pi_V held, price clears | session_01PpnqC2wyZrmsMJNMvbr89D, remote_decomp_shares_C.sh fixpv | - | launched 18:21 |
| S-fixp | Table 5: price held (= perfectly elastic supply), pi_V clears | session_01Rc5f71NPBc4XASW7thMJEn, remote_decomp_shares_C.sh fixp | - | launched 18:21 |
| P70 | detection 0.70 | session_01XQrGMFU8DqProc67i3gsbD, code/pdet/remote_pdet_C.sh 0.70 -> results/counterfactuals_2c/tf_pdet70_C | C1 warm start | launched 18:21 |
| P50 | detection 0.50 | session_01U7N2fZm3a9RRLNJjSYYWY8, code/pdet/remote_pdet_C.sh 0.50 -> results/counterfactuals_2c/tf_pdet50_C | C1 warm start | launched 18:21 |
| DD0 | delta_d = delta_h = 0, one class: benchmark re-solved, Housing First, Treatment First on rule C, then fixboth and fixp (fixp = perfectly elastic supply, the author's point on the small gain) | session_01McpMNmiZC346o9SRtsHdqz, code/deltad/remote_deltad1c_C.sh + remote_deltad1c_decomp_C.sh -> results/deltad/dd0_1c_C, dd0_1c_C_decomp | - | launched 18:46 |
| TR | the T = 70 transition on rule C (two loops) and the cohort-print loop | cloud session | C1 accepted | after C1 |
| PAPER | exporters re-pointed to the rule-C arms, every number regenerated, Section 4's rule and its footnote, the rule-A footnote, introduction and abstract; red, struck deletions, notes | this session | arms land | as they land |
| CODE | the code/ scripts reorganised (REFEREE_PLAN item 5) | this session | no run executing them | last |

## Gates
- C1 inert check (pass 1): welfare differs from rule A's 789.9399 at the same start, and the MILBY SPLIT line shows
  voucher holders with a SUD in treatment. Fail -> stop, diagnose, tell the author before anything else launches.
- Every arm: DIST CHECK PASS, budget cleared (TARGET CHECK PASS) where pi_V clears, no GUARD.
- The paper is rebuilt only from accepted arms; the checkers pass; the author gets the PDF with every change red.

## On each check (every 30 minutes: the routine at :17 and a second at :47)
The author, 12 Oct: "make sure to check that all the runs are working all the time so we dont waste time".
1. Fetch. For every live rule-C session: get_session (status_bucket failed or a rate-limit stop = dead) and the last
   commit on its results folder. Silent for 45 minutes while solving, or 90 while building or in a transition loop that
   publishes less often = dead.
2. A run that is alive but not advancing is wasting time too: the pass count must rise at least every 90 minutes, and an
   arm whose budget gap and drug gap have stopped falling for 4 passes is reported to the author with its passes table.
3. A dead run is relaunched at once in a fresh session with the same brief (arms resume from their last published pass);
   a run that dies twice is reported, not relaunched. A rate-limit stop is relaunched on another model if one is available.
4. One line to the author when nothing changed; a message at once when something died, stalled or landed.
